# Problem: The Dyson fan doesn't have auto-shutoff capabilities. The "auto" preset
# continues to blow hot air at the lowest speed to maintain the same temperature,
# once the desired temperature has been reached.
#
# Desired State: It is OK for temperature to fluctuate between a specified range.
# When the room gets too cold (as measured by the fan), the heat should turn on
# to warm it up until an acceptable level is reached. Then, it should turn off
# and let the room gradually cool down naturally.
#
# TODO: Consider moving more of this logic to a script layer. Specifically, by converting
# the trigger variable to a script input, we are able to better test this logic without needing
# to actually wait for a specific temperature to be hit.
