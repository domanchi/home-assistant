# Problem: We want to configure the severity level from the dashboard.
#
# Solution: HomeAssistant provides this capability as an `input_number` entity.
# It tracks the state independently, and can be used instead of `saver`.
# However, this `input_number` needs to be connected to the rest of the
# automation.
#
# Therefore, we construct the following state diagram:
#
# [ input_number.pollen_severity ] <-- changed from dashboard
#                |
#          (on change)
#                â†“                    ___________________
# [ automation.pollen-severity ] --> | perform action    |
#              (on cron trigger) --> | based on severity |
#
