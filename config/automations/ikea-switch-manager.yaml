# The IKEA STYRBAR Switch is a useful tactile tool that essentially allows
# configurable, arbitrary API commands on a Zigbee network. It has four buttons,
# and 12 event listeners (each button has press, hold, release).

alias: IKEA Switch Manager
description: Action to take when the IKEA Switch's buttons are pressed.

# Each button is independent of each other, and state is outsourced to the underlying
# scripts. As such, we can have parallel request handling.
#
# Also, for some reason, "single" does not work.
mode: parallel

  # TODO(2024-01-04): The battery died today, with no indication that this triggered.
  # In closer investigation, it looks like the below heuristic does not work (logs showed that
  # this was a static value, despite the battery dying).
  #
  # I hypothesize that a firmware upgrade may be needed, but I don't know how to revert back
  # in the case that goes wrong. As such, we'll just need to rely on runbook to change battery
  # until we can actually fix this.
